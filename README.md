# 🎨 Design Patterns in Java

This repository contains concise, well-documented examples of **Design Patterns** implemented in **Java**.  
Each pattern is demonstrated with simple, real-world-inspired code and short explanations.

## 📚 Overview

Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems.  
They help make code **flexible**, **reusable**, and **maintainable**.

This repo covers:

- ✅ **Creational Patterns** — Object creation mechanisms
- ⚙️ **Structural Patterns** — Composition and relationships between classes/objects
- 🔁 **Behavioral Patterns** — Communication and interaction between objects

## 🚀 Implemented Patterns

### 🔁 Behavioral Patterns

| Pattern | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[Strategy](src/pattern/strategy)** | Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. |
| **[Observer](src/pattern/observer)** | Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. |
